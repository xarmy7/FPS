# **FPS**

FPS made using the previous engine for the 3D Platformer.

**/!\ This engine is not the most optimized one nor the most efficient one. It supports only .obj models, .mtl materials and a custom scene format. /!\\**

# Informations

The resources (obj, textures, mtl, etc) are in the zip file on sirius : RMLG/BIN/resources.
